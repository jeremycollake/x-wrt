	  rsync is a program that allows files to be copied to
	  and from remote machines in much the same way as rcp.
	  It has many more options than rcp, and uses the rsync
	  remote-update protocol to greatly speed up file
	  transfers when the destination file already exists.
	  
	  The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to
	  transfer just the differences between two sets of files 
	  across the network link.
