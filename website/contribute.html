        We always need developers, testers, documentation writers, translators, and support personnel. Our project is truly OPEN and FREE.
        Anyone can come join our project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to get write access to our repository, just create an account at <a href=
        "http://code.google.com/p/x-wrt/">http://code.google.com/p/x-wrt/</a> and email <a href="mailto:xwrt-private-dev@lists.berlios.de">xwrt-private-dev@lists.berlios.de</a> or contact one of our
        other developers on the irc channel (#x-wrt / freenode). We do not make anyone pass an 'entrance exam', though we do like for
        people to supply a patch of some sort just to prove that you are serious.
      </p>
      <p>
        A listing of some of the needs we have are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>development
        </li>
        <li>graphic artists
        </li>
        <li>localization (translation)
        </li>
        <li>documentation/wiki editors
        </li>
        <li>user support
        </li>
        <li>proliferators
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are some things you can help us with if you choose. When a person makes a donation, that donation is cataloged and made
        available to whichever developer is in the most need of it at the time. We do have a public list of donators (or at least will,
        whenever we get some donations).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>hardware donations.</strong> You can donate routers or other hardware to our developers, who may be in need of them for
          testing purposes. We are currently running our poor routers into the ground, so we encourage these type of donations. Devices
          needed:
          <ul>
            <li>Any router with a USB port.
            </li>
            <li>Any router you want us to work on support for.
            </li>
            <li>Anything you have left lying around.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>spread the word.</strong> Tell people you think might be interested about our project. Not even all OpenWrt users have
          heard of our project yet. You might consider mentioning X-Wrt on the OpenWrt forums and in #openwrt on freenode.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To prevent troubles with where money should go, we don't accept project-wide monetary donations. However, some developers do accept
        direct donations to them. We suggest you check the Berlios roster of developers of this project and develop to whichever people you
        choose. Also, if you want to see a particular feature developed, perhaps donating to a developer will encourage him or her to
        pursue that feature more quickly than he or she would have otherwise done.
